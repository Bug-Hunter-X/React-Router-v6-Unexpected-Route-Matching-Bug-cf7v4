The exact manifestation varies based on the specific route configuration.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, addressing the unexpected route matching issue.  The solution usually involves careful review of route paths, avoiding overlapping path patterns, using exact matching where necessary, and employing nested routes effectively.
